\title{Get Cluster Assignments with Original Data}
\usage{
get_cluster_assignments(
  results,
  model_name = NULL,
  include_probabilities = FALSE,
  cluster_col_name = "cluster"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{Object from clustering()}

\item{model_name}{Name of the model to use. If NULL (default), uses the best
model by BIC.}

\item{include_probabilities}{Logical. If TRUE, includes probability of
membership for each cluster. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{cluster_col_name}{Name for the cluster assignment column.
Defaults to "cluster".}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the original data plus cluster assignments
  (and optionally probabilities).
}
\description{
Extracts cluster assignments from a fitted model and adds them to the
original data frame. Optionally includes cluster membership probabilities.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
results <- clustering(data, vars, n_clusters = 3)

# Get data with cluster assignments
data_with_clusters <- get_cluster_assignments(results)

# Specify a particular model
data_with_clusters <- get_cluster_assignments(results, model_name = "VVV")

# Include membership probabilities
data_with_clusters <- get_cluster_assignments(results, include_probabilities = TRUE)
}

\title{Assess Cluster Stability via Bootstrap}
\usage{
assess_cluster_stability(
  results,
  model_name = NULL,
  n_boot = 100,
  verbose = TRUE,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{Object from clustering()}

\item{model_name}{Model to assess (single model). If NULL, uses best model by BIC.}

\item{n_boot}{Number of bootstrap iterations. Defaults to 100.}

\item{verbose}{Print progress. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility. Defaults to NULL.}
}
\value{
A list of class "cluster_stability" containing:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{overall_stability}}: Mean Adjusted Rand Index across bootstraps
  \item{\code{stability_sd}}: Standard deviation of ARI
  \item{\code{bootstrap_ari}}: Vector of ARI values for each bootstrap
  \item{\code{observation_stability}}: Proportion of times each observation
    was assigned to the same cluster as in the original
  \item{\code{cluster_stability}}: Stability score for each cluster
  \item{\code{interpretation}}: Text interpretation of stability
}
}
\description{
Evaluates the stability of cluster assignments for a SINGLE selected model
using bootstrap resampling. For each bootstrap sample, the clustering is
re-run with the same model specification and assignments are compared to
the original using the Adjusted Rand Index.

Note: This function assesses one model at a time. If you tested multiple
models, use the model_name parameter to specify which model to assess,
or leave NULL to use the best model by BIC.

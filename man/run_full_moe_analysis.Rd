\title{Run a Full, Multi-Model MoEClust Analysis}
\usage{
run_full_moe_analysis(
  input_data,
  cluster_vars,
  n_clusters,
  scaling_method = "standardize"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{A data frame or tibble containing the dataset. It should
include at least the variables specified in `cluster_vars`.}

\item{cluster_vars}{A character vector of column names from `input_data` to be
used for the clustering analysis.}

\item{n_clusters}{An integer specifying the number of clusters (G) to fit.}

\item{scaling_method}{A character string specifying the preprocessing method
to be applied to the data before clustering. Defaults to "standardize".
Possible options are:
\itemize{
  \item{"`standardize`"}: Z-score transformation (mean 0, sd 1). Recommended for most cases.
  \item{"`center`"}: Subtracts the mean from each variable (mean 0).
  \item{"`minmax`"}: Scales the data to a range of [0, 1].
  \item{"`none`"}: No scaling is applied. Use with caution.
}}
}
\value{
A deeply nested list containing the results for every successfully
  fitted model. The structure for each model (e.g., `results$VEV`) is:
  \itemize{
    \item{`model`}: The raw `MoEClust` model object, containing BIC, log-likelihood, etc.
    \item{`outputs_original`}: A list of results based on the original data scale.
      \itemize{
        \item{`means_table`}: A tibble of cluster means for each variable in their original units.
        \item{`profile_plot`}: A ggplot object showing the cluster profiles on the original scale.
      }
    \item{`outputs_scaled`}: A list of results based on the scaled data.
      \itemize{
        \item{`means_table`}: A tibble of cluster means for the scaled variables.
        \item{`profile_plot`}: A ggplot object showing the cluster profiles on the scaled data.
      }
    \item{`size_table`}: A `janitor::tabyl` object showing the number and percentage of observations in each cluster.
  }
}
\description{
This is the core function of the script. It systematically performs a
comprehensive clustering analysis by iterating through all 14 possible covariance
models provided by the `MoEClust` package for a given number of clusters (G).
It incorporates robust error handling to prevent the entire process from
stopping if a single model fails to converge.

For each successfully fitted model, the function generates a rich set of outputs,
critically providing results based on both the **original data scale** (for
interpretability) and the **scaled data** (on which the clustering was performed).
